=head1 NAME

Sort::Hash1 Version1 of SortHash

=head1 VERSION 

1.042

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Sort::Hash1 is included in the distribution for backwards compatibility. If you used Sort::Hash and don't want to fix the code right now, use Sort::Hash1. If you are writing or maintaining your code use Sort::Hash instead. 

=head2 sort_hash

The interface to sort_hash changed from version 1 to version 2. Instead of taking a hash of values it now takes a list in which the first item must be a reference to the hash to sort. Sort::Hash1 will be removed from the distribution in the future, updating your code is easy:

 sort_hash( desc => 1 , alpha => 1, %somehash );
 becomes
 sort_hash( \%somehash, 'desc', 'alpha' );

    my $numeric     = delete $H{numeric}     || 1;
